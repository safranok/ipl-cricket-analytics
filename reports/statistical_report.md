# Statistical Validation Report

## Step 4 — Statistical Testing



## T1 — Does winning the toss help you win the match?

**Finding:** Toss winners won 51.64% of decisive matches.

**Statistical question:** Is the toss winner's match-win rate significantly different from 50%?

**Null hypothesis:** H₀: Toss winners win 50% of decisive matches.

**Test:** Binomial test.

**Sample size:** n = 1,187

**Observed rate:** 51.64%

**p-value:** 0.2700

**Effect size:** 1.64 percentage points above 50%.

**95% confidence interval:** 48.80% to 54.48%.

**Verdict:** The test did not provide enough evidence to conclude that winning the toss changes the probability of winning the match.

---

## T2 — Does the decision taken after the toss matter?

**Finding:** Toss winners who chose to field had a higher match-win rate than those who chose to bat.

**Statistical question:** Is toss decision associated with whether the toss winner wins the match?

**Null hypothesis:** H₀: Toss decision and toss-winner match outcome are independent.

**Test:** Chi-square test of independence.

**Sample size:** n = 1,187

**Observed results:**

- Chose to bat: 184 wins, 218 losses — 45.77%
- Chose to field: 429 wins, 356 losses — 54.65%

**Chi-square:** 8.04

**Degrees of freedom:** 1

**p-value:** 0.0046

**Effect size:** Cramér's V ≈ 0.082.

**Verdict:** The test provides evidence of an association between toss decision and toss-winner match outcome, although the association effect is small.

## T3 — Does the chasing team really have an advantage?

**Finding:** Chasing teams won 54.51% of decisive matches.

**Statistical question:** Is the chasing team's win rate significantly different from 50%?

**Null hypothesis:** H₀: Chasing teams win 50% of decisive matches.

**Test:** Binomial test.

**Sample size:** n = 1,187

**Chases won:** 647

**Observed rate:** 54.51%

**p-value:** 0.0021

**Effect size:** 4.51 percentage points above 50%.

**95% confidence interval:** 51.66% to 57.32%.

**Verdict:** The test provides evidence that the chasing team's win rate differs from 50%, with the observed rate 4.51 percentage points higher.

---

## T4 — Does the chase win rate fall as the target rises?

**Finding:** Chase success decreases as the first-innings target increases.

**Statistical question:** Is chase outcome associated with the target band?

**Null hypothesis:** H₀: Chase outcome is independent of target band.

**Test:** Chi-square test of independence.

**Sample size:** n = 1,187

**Target-band results:**

| Target band | Won | Lost | Chase win rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Under 140 | 181 | 38 | 82.6% |
| 140–159 | 171 | 70 | 71.0% |
| 160–179 | 166 | 146 | 53.2% |
| 180–199 | 83 | 134 | 38.2% |
| 200+ | 46 | 152 | 23.2% |

**Chi-square:** 197.68

**Degrees of freedom:** 4

**p-value:** approximately 1 × 10⁻⁴¹

**Effect size:** Cramér's V ≈ 0.408.

**Verdict:** The test provides very strong evidence that chase success differs across target bands.

---

## T5 — Are defended totals actually bigger than chased totals?

**Finding:** Matches in which the first-innings total was successfully defended had higher first-innings totals than matches where the target was successfully chased.

**Statistical question:** Do defended and successfully chased matches have different mean first-innings totals?

**Null hypothesis:** H₀: The two groups have the same mean first-innings total.

**Test:** Welch independent t-test.

**Sample size:** n = 1,187

**Successfully defended:** n = 540, mean = 183.3 runs

**Successfully chased:** n = 647, mean = 155.5 runs

**Mean difference:** 27.8 runs

**t-statistic:** 15.73

**p-value:** approximately 1 × 10⁻⁵⁰

**Effect size:** Cohen's d = 0.92.

**Verdict:** The test provides strong evidence that defended matches had higher first-innings totals, with a large effect size of 0.92.

---

## T6 — Is the Powerplay really faster than the Middle overs?

**Finding:** Powerplay run rate appeared slightly higher than Middle-over run rate.

**Statistical question:** Is Powerplay run rate significantly different from Middle-over run rate within the same innings?

**Null hypothesis:** H₀: The mean Powerplay and Middle-over run rates are equal.

**Test:** Paired t-test.

**Sample size:** n = 2,406 innings

**Powerplay average run rate:** 8.02

**Middle-over average run rate:** 7.95

**Mean difference:** 0.08 runs per over

**t-statistic:** 1.53

**p-value:** 0.1259

**Effect size:** Paired Cohen's d ≈ 0.031.

**Verdict:** The test did not provide enough evidence to conclude that Powerplay run rate differs from Middle-over run rate.

---

## T7 — Do left-handers really hit harder than right-handers?

**Finding:** Left-handed batters appeared to have a similar strike rate to right-handed batters.

**Statistical question:** Do left-handed and right-handed batters have different average strike rates?

**Null hypothesis:** H₀: Left-handed and right-handed batters have the same mean strike rate.

**Test:** Welch independent t-test.

**Sample size:** n = 137 batters.

**Left-handed batters:** n = 50, mean strike rate = 136.60

**Right-handed batters:** n = 87, mean strike rate = 136.62

**Mean difference:** 0.02

**p-value:** 0.9942

**Effect size:** Cohen's d = 0.001.

**Verdict:** The test did not provide enough evidence to conclude that left-handed and right-handed batters differ in average strike rate.

---

## T8 — Are spinners genuinely cheaper than fast bowlers?

**Finding:** Spin bowlers had a lower average economy rate than pace bowlers.

**Statistical question:** Do spin and pace bowlers have different average economy rates?

**Null hypothesis:** H₀: Spin and pace bowlers have the same mean economy rate.

**Test:** Welch independent t-test.

**Sample size:** n = 149 bowlers.

**Spin bowlers:** n = 49, average economy = 7.68

**Pace bowlers:** n = 100, average economy = 8.49

**Mean difference:** 0.80 runs per over.

**p-value:** approximately 9 × 10⁻¹¹

**Effect size:** Cohen's d = 1.18.

**Verdict:** The test provides strong evidence that spin and pace bowlers have different average economy rates, with a large effect size.

---

## T9 — Does Sawai Mansingh really favour the chasing team?

**Finding:** Sawai Mansingh Stadium had a 65.15% chase win rate compared with the league-wide rate of 54.51%.

**Statistical question:** Is the venue's chase win rate significantly different from the league-wide chase win rate?

**Null hypothesis:** H₀: The venue's chase win rate is equal to the league-wide rate of 54.51%.

**Test:** Binomial test.

**Sample size:** n = 66

**Chases won:** 43

**Venue chase rate:** 65.15%

**League chase rate:** 54.51%

**p-value:** 0.0849

**Effect size:** 10.64 percentage points above the league rate.

**95% confidence interval:** 53.11% to 75.52%.

**Verdict:** The test did not provide enough evidence to conclude that Sawai Mansingh Stadium's chase win rate differs from the league-wide rate.

---

## T10 — Has scoring genuinely risen across the seasons?

**Finding:** Average innings score increased across the seasons.

**Statistical question:** Is there a significant positive linear relationship between season year and average innings score?

**Null hypothesis:** H₀: There is no linear relationship between season year and average innings score.

**Test:** Pearson correlation.

**Sample size:** n = 19 seasons.

**First-season average:** 154.6 runs

**Last-season average:** 184.0 runs

**Pearson correlation:** r = 0.862

**R²:** 0.743

**p-value:** 0.0000021

**Effect size:** Pearson r = 0.862.

**Verdict:** The test provides strong evidence of a positive linear association between season year and average innings score.

**Alternative explanation:** The increase could also be associated with changes in bat technology, boundary sizes, playing rules, pitch/venue conditions, or changes in team composition. Correlation alone does not establish that time itself caused the increase.

# Overall Statistical Summary

The statistical tests show that some Step 3 findings are supported by statistical evidence while others are not.

The toss-winner finding did not survive statistical testing. The chasing advantage, target-band relationship, defended-versus-chased total difference, and bowling-style economy difference were supported by the corresponding tests. The Powerplay versus Middle-over difference, left-versus-right batting strike-rate difference, and Sawai Mansingh venue difference did not have enough statistical evidence at the 0.05 level.

The season analysis showed a strong positive correlation between season year and average innings score, although this correlation does not establish causation.
